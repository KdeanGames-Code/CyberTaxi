                    delivery (2-3 days if no stock at Tesla Service Centers,

                    Used Market: Various wear levels (price reflects that, e.g.,
                    10% base reduction from purchase price, further reduced by %
                    of wear on the vehicle; repair before sale increases value).

                <li>
                    Lease Terms: Monthly renewable, with options to pay
                    quarterly (5% discount) or yearly (10% discount).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Locations: Available in various Austin areas with
                    demand-based pricing (e.g., downtown high-demand = higher
                    cost, suburbs low-demand = lower cost). Specific sites and
                    numbers TBD (start with 5-10 locations, expand as users
                    added).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Size and Cost: Small garage for 2 CyberTaxis, 500 sq ft,
                    $1,500/month (adjustable post-playtest). Fits 2 cars
                    (real-world 2-car garages are ~400-600 sq ft—500 sq ft is
                    tight but doable with efficient layout). Lease/buy larger
                    spaces if wanted, but costs more (e.g., means fewer
                    revenue-generating vehicles).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Garages and Lots: Leases and outright purchase options, with
                    selling capability. Selling returns 100% of the purchase
                    price for base game (market value fluctuations TBD for
                    version 2—no penalties).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Listings: Heat map toggle for demand (static for consistent
                    day patterns, dynamic for time/events/special occasions).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Initial Garage State: Leased garage is empty. Options for
                    plug-in charger (cheaper) vs. wireless (expensive).
                    Construction time: Real-time-ish (e.g., 1-3 days for
                    chargers, depending on number; week or two for expansions).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Construction Bars: Progress bars for construction (e.g.,
                    charger install), with map toggle for construction sites and
                    demand views. Design as "next-level Space X shit"

                </li>
                <li>
                    Charging Rates: Cheaper than SuperChargers (e.g., $0.12/kWh
                    vs. $0.25-$0.50/kWh public). Adjust post-playtest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Action: Player selects and pays for a garage from a list or
                    map after signup; it becomes their base.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Parking Spaces: Separate from vehicle slots (e.g., 3 parking
                    spaces for 500 sq ft garage, giving total 5 spaces—more cars
                    require lots or new locations; future expansions).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Perks: No explicit perks (e.g., +20% earnings); proximity to
                    demand is the natural perk (closer garages allow faster
                    response to fares, as closest free CyberTaxi gets the ride).
