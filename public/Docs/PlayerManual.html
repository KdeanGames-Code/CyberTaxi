            <h1>CyberTaxi Player Manual (Detailed Draft)</h1>
            <p>
                This detailed draft of the CyberTaxi Player Manual is based on
                the latest Game Design Document (GDD), Gameplay Draft, and
                Project Plan as of July 29, 2025. It expands on core mechanics,
                UI interactions, strategies, and troubleshooting for testing
                purposes. All mechanics align with Completed Chunks 1-14, with
                notes on pending features. Use this for onboarding simulations
                and balance feedback.
            </p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                CyberTaxi is a strategy/simulation game where you manage a fleet
                of autonomous Tesla RoboTaxis in real-time urban environments,
                starting in Austin, TX. As a Progressive Web App (PWA), it
                supports offline play for viewing cached data (e.g., fleet
                status, maps) and syncs upon reconnection. The game targets
                strategy fans, Tesla enthusiasts, and gamers who enjoy deep
                management sims.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Core Loop:</strong> Purchase/lease vehicles and garages,
                deploy your fleet to high-demand areas, earn fares from rides,
                manage wear/battery/maintenance, and expand operations while
                competing on leaderboards. Time runs in full real-time (1:1
                ratio—no acceleration), encouraging ongoing engagement via
                notifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Themes:</strong> Realism in autonomous taxi
                management, competition for fares, and adaptation to urban
                challenges like demand fluctuations and events.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Platform Notes:</strong> Access via
                https://CyberTaxiGame.com. Install as a PWA for home screen
                addition, offline access, and push notifications (e.g., vehicle
                deliveries, low battery alerts).
            </p>
            <div class="tip">
                Tip: For optimal experience, enable notifications during signup
                to stay alerted on real-time events like stock arrivals or
                maintenance completions, even when the app is closed.
            </div>
            <div class="warning">
                Warning: Offline mode limits actions like purchases or live
                routing—reconnect for full functionality. Data syncs
                automatically to prevent loss.
            </div>

            <h2>1. Starting the Game</h2>
            <p>
                Begin at https://CyberTaxiGame.com, where the landing page
                serves as a store/signup hub. It showcases progress updates,
                gameplay teasers, and tier options to hook new players.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Signup Process:</strong> Enter
                    email/username/password. Skippable onboarding modals guide
                    you through basics (e.g., "Welcome! Let's lease your first
                    garage."). Modals include tooltips and progress trackers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Free Tier:</strong> Starts with $60,000 bank
                    balance. Use it freely for any purchase, like a small garage
                    or your first vehicle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subscription Tier:</strong> Adds $140,000 to your
                    bank, enabling faster scaling (e.g., ordering 2 Model Ys and
                    2 RoboCabs). This money is versatile—spend on garages,
                    chargers, or staff. Subscriptions support development and
                    unlock cosmetic badges on leaderboards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Initial Bank Balance:</strong> $60,000 (free) or
                    $200,000 total (subscription). Displayed in the top menu
                    with real-time updates.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>UI Entry Point:</strong> Post-signup, load into the
                Austin map view with top menu (bank, score, energy bar) and side
                buttons for flyouts (fleet, garage, company, charging).
            </p>
            <div class="tip">
                Advanced Strategy: Use initial funds to lease a suburban garage
                (low cost) for storage, then expand downtown for high-demand
                fares. Monitor the demand heat map toggle early.
            </div>
            <div class="warning">
                Warning: Bank overdrafts aren't possible—purchases fail if funds
                are insufficient, prompting a "Insufficient Funds" modal with
                earning tips.
            </div>

            <h2>2. Vehicle Purchases</h2>
            <p>
                Access the in-game Tesla browser section via the fleet flyout or
                map menu. Vehicles are essential for earning—order new or browse
                used markets.

                    Service Centers (3-8 per day, random arrival times for
                    realism). If out of stock, delivery takes 2-3 days
                    (real-time). Vehicles deliver only to garages—ensure you

                <li>

                    arrived at Downtown Garage!"). Mobile-friendly for on-the-go
                    management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Action Steps:</strong> 1. Open Tesla browser flyout.
                    2. Select model/quantity. 3. Confirm order (deducts from
                    bank). 4. Track progress in fleet window with timers.

                <strong>Balance Notes:</strong> Prices and delivery times
                adjustable post-playtest for fairness. Subscription funds
                accelerate this phase without skipping mechanics.
            </p>
            <div class="tip">
                Pro Tip: Time purchases around demand surges (e.g.,
                events)—monitor service centers via map pins for stock. Buy used
                for quick starts, but factor in repair costs (e.g., 5-15% of
                price based on wear).

            <p>
                New players receive guided onboarding to ease into real-time
                mechanics. The game emphasizes frustration-free entry with
                skippable elements.

                    session-based play (e.g., check-ins for management).

                    Welcome overview. 2. Garage selection map (heat map
                    tutorial). 3. First vehicle order demo. 4. Basic controls
                    (flyouts, map toggles). Restart option in settings.

            <p>
                <strong>Verbatim Formula (from GDD):</strong> Total Fare = $4.20

                post-playtest).
